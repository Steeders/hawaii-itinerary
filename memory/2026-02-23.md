## First Session

- Came online for the first time
- Named Kevin by Russell
- Bootstrap complete

## Brain Dump Transcript (voice memo)

Russell shared a ~40-minute voice memo. Key info captured in USER.md.

### TL;DR of what we learned:
- Russell is a fractional CMO with ~10 years experience
- Multiple clients: Zip String, Amped Bikes, Aubrey Live, Treads Plus, Kivu + others
- Runs a podcast called "The Fundamental Edge" — principle-based business podcast
- Biggest immediate pain: editing backlog (episode 4, 2 weeks delayed), content creation for clients (Aubrey Live needs 15-20 creatives/month, currently at 3)
- Canceling VA ($300/mo), buying Mac Mini, redirecting budget to AI
- Wants a business database, podcast pipeline, weekly podcast briefs, campaign brief system
- Hates AI being a yes-man; wants Socratic/scientific method in research
- Wants to genuinely learn the material, not just have AI do it

## Videos Watched

1. OpenClaw overview video (Alex Finn) — covered setup, morning brief, mission control, brains/muscles, reverse prompting, security

## Setup Completed Today
- Named Kevin by Russell ✅
- Brain dump transcribed and saved to USER.md ✅
- Whisper configured: `--model turbo --device mps --fp16 False` (M4 GPU) ✅

## Whisper Notes
- MPS + FP16 crashes (NaN errors) — must use --fp16 False
- MPS + FP32 is similar speed to CPU for turbo model (~42 min for 40 min audio)
- TODO: Set up mlx-whisper for much faster transcription on M4

## Next Steps
- Set up mlx-whisper for faster audio transcription
- Build MEMORY.md with long-term context
- Set up morning brief cron job
- Build podcast production pipeline
- Build business database
- Set up weekly podcast briefs
- Campaign brief system for clients
