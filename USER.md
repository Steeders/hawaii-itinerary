# USER.md - About Russell

- **Name:** Russell
- **What to call them:** Russell
- **Pronouns:** he/him (inferred)
- **Timezone:** America/Denver (MST)
- **First contact:** 2026-02-23

## Background

- Physics degree
- ~10 years of marketing + operations experience
- Co-founded a warranty management software (sold to Corso)
- Got fired from Corso after a strategy/leadership conflict — good war story
- Now a **fractional CMO** — embedded with multiple clients simultaneously
- Looks at the whole business: ads → landing pages → product → ops → post-purchase

## Current Clients

- **Zip String** — kid's toy, launched their most successful Kickstarter ever
- **Amped Bikes** — e-commerce, treated almost as employee; doing marketing + operations (driving to their Las Vegas warehouse)
- **Aubrey Live** — fitness influencers, digital products; needs 15–20 ad creatives/month (currently at 3 😬)
- **Treads Plus** — stair nose flooring, DTC, going fast; needs lots of content
- **Kivu** — consumer AI software
- Other software company + others TBD

## Tools / Stack

- **Claude** — existing subscription + Corso tokens
- **ClickUp** — task management
- **Riverside** — podcast recording, transcription, editing
- **Captivate** — podcast hosting
- **ElevenLabs** — (possible use, TBD)
- **Mercury** — wants to consolidate all subscriptions/payments here
- **Contractor** — good at copywriting, ideas, landing page analysis; NOT a designer/creative

## Finances

- Canceling VA Abdul ($300/month) → redirecting to AI
- Buying Mac Mini at Costco ($600) to run OpenClaw locally
- Careful about token usage — be smart with model selection

## Personality / Work Style

- Direct, self-aware, tells good stories
- Wants to genuinely *learn* things, not just have AI do it
- Hates AI being a "yes man" — wants skeptical pushback, Socratic method
- Cares about intellectual honesty: no cherry-picking, find real principles
- Thinks holistically across entire business functions

## The Fundamental Edge (Podcast)

- **Status:** 4 episodes created, episode 4 unedited (2 weeks delayed)
- **Format:** Principle-first — pick a real, defensible business principle, validate it with multiple examples FOR and AGAINST (not cherry-picked)
- **Goal:** Entertain first, teach second. Story arc matters. Not a listicle.
- **Pain points:**
  - Editing is a huge time sink (~1 hour per episode in Riverside)
  - AI is a yes-man when researching/validating principles
  - No natural single-story arc (intentional but tricky to make engaging)
  - Wants to personally understand the material before recording
- **Workflow idea:** Principle → validate/disprove → research businesses → learn (quiz) → outline → record → AI-edit → show notes → Captivate

## Podcast Briefs

Wants weekly AI-generated briefs from favorite podcasts. Two buckets:

**Business/Principles bucket:**
- Founders (David Senra)
- David Senra interviews podcast
- How to Take Over the World
- Becoming the Main Character
- All In (partially)

**Marketing/Current events bucket:**
- Marketing Against the Grain
- Smarter Marketer podcast
- Startup Ideas podcast
- All In (partially)

## Key Projects to Build

1. **Business Database** — links to Forbes, HBR, blog articles about businesses; later synthesize with stronger model; add personal voice memo brain dumps + podcast transcripts
2. **Podcast Production Pipeline** — research → validate → learn (quiz) → script → record → AI-edit → publish
3. **Weekly Podcast Briefs** — auto-pull/transcribe episodes, synthesize, deliver brief
4. **Campaign Brief System** — analyze competitor/adjacent ads, generate creative briefs for clients
5. **Personal Story Database** — capture Russell's personal experiences and stories for podcast use
